                We started the journey as a small team with only a handful of players in 2022.

                But after officially registering in 2025, Queensland Deccan Chargers was established with a vision to promote cricket and nurture talent at all levels.
                
                What began as a small group of passionate cricketers has grown into a well-respected organisation, fostering talent and providing opportunities for players to excel.
                
                Over the years, we have expanded our reach, organizing and competing in competitive leagues.
                
                With a strong foundation built on sportsmanship, dedication, and excellence, we continue to shape the future of cricket, inspiring the next generation of cricketers.
                
                🏏Play. Compete. Inspire.🏆
